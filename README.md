Reflection:

This assignment was extremely difficult, but I am so satified to be finished. There were some aspects of the visualizations I could not do, such as make a tooltip for the generation plot that changed based on the stack the mouse hovered over. I also could not make the style exactly like the videos. I can now realize there are so many possibilities and things we don't know that we can't make it perfect, but pretty close!
This was exciting (also quite rough)!
The tip about taking this one step at a time really helped. If you do too many things at once, it's overwhelming and you don't know what to fix.
