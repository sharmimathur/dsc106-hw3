oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand
things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she
is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one
thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will
not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just
one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders
loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to
find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer
did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot
understand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for
himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they
promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not
perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and
that all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe a
word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian
neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty
destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe
